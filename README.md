# Kanban Board
## Idea 
This project consists of a very rudimentary version of a Kanban/Trello board, currently usable by a single user (which I know for the most part, is not very useful). The app allows a user to create an account, log in, create projects, add tasks to said projects, and progress the tasks through 3 states of completion: "TO DO", "In-Progress" and "Completed". The app offers a very minimal/barebones/ugly user interface (chose a descriptor based on however polite or accurate you like to be, I did not view this as a front end project.) 

This is a project built to display my understanding of several concepts.  
1. ActiveRecord & Sinatra.  
2. MVC program architecture.  
3. CRUD functionality.
4. Using multiple models.  
5. Modelling user accounts.
6. User authentication.
7. Input validation.
